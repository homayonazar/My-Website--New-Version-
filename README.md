# My Own Website (React-TypeScript)

This is my **personal portfolio website**, designed and developed to showcase my skills, projects, and achievements in **Front-End Development**.

> Previously, I had built this website using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, but now I have **rebuilt it with React** to make it fully dynamic, responsive, and more interactive.  
> This version is not exactly like the previous one; it includes **small improvements and changes** in design and functionality.

The goal of this project is to provide a professional online presence with a clean design, responsive layout, and smooth user experience.
